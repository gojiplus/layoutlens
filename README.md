### LayoutLens: AI-Enabled UI Test System

Write visual UI tests using natural language to 

1. Compare current layouts to previous versions for consistency.
2. Validate layout relationships (e.g., "is the right box bigger than the left").
3. Check positioning (e.g., "is the menu at the top of the page but below the header").
4. Assess text formatting (e.g., "is the text justified").
5. Provide insights into UI design to ensure compliance with design specifications.

The system capture screenshots of the current UI state, compares to reference images for layout and styling consistency, identify differences in size, position, color, and text alignment, etc.
